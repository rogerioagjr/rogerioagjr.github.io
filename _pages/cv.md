Education
======
### California Institute of Technology
*Pasadena, CA* | *Sep 2021 - Jun 2026*
* Incoming Candidate for Ph.D. in Computation and Neural Systems

### Massachusetts Institute of Technology
*Cambridge, MA* | *Sep 2017 - Jun 2021*
* Candidate for Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering
* Candidate for Bachelor of Science in Linguistics and Philosophy

Work experience
======
### MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) - [*www.lids.mit.edu*](http://www.lids.mit.edu)
*Cambridge, MA* | *Jan 2019 - Present*

**Undergraduate Researcher**
* **Reinforcement Learning for Agricultural Management 
  Policy Recommendation** *(February 2020 - Present)*

  Developed models for automated optimal 
  decision-making in agricultural management in 
  Sub-Saharan Africa based on crop yield using Deep 
  Reinforcement Learning. The WOFOST model was used 
  to simulate farms and generate artificial data to 
  train the models. This work is still in completion.
  
* **Nonlinear Dynamical Systems** *(September 2019 - 
  December 2019)*
  
  Investigated the use of Recurrent Neural Networks 
  in predicting the behavior of Nonlinear Dynamical 
  Systems. Found that Convolutional layers improved 
  sensibility to local changes in the behavior of the 
  system. Presented the work in a poster in the 
  SuperUROP Showcase, part of the Advanced 
  Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program.
  
* **Seizure Detection** *(January 2019 - May 2019)*
  
  Developed models for the prediction of seizure events
  in epilepsy patients based on time-series data from
  their EEG readings. Identified feature extraction 
  and data resampling techniques that maintained 
  interpretability while maximizing the accuracy of 
  common machine learning models.

### Bridgewater Associates - [*www.bridgewater.com*](https://www.bridgewater.com)
*Westport, CT* | *Jun 2020 - Aug 2020*

**Investment Engineering Intern**
* Utilizing learned macroeconomics concepts and 
  understanding of global markets, analyzed select 
  case studies to develop hypothesis of what was
  happening in the business cycle.
  
* Analyzed and built a fully automated sample bond 
  trading system.
  
### Pegasystems - [*www.pega.com*](https://www.pega.com)
*Cambridge, MA* | *Jun 2019 - Aug 2019*

**Software Engineering Intern**
* Member of a core engineering team with the task to 
  speed up the initialization of Kubernetes nodes when
  running Pega Platform, the main product of the 
  company, in the cloud.
  
* Collaborator in the root cause analysis that found a
  bottleneck caused by requests to the database for java
  classes. Worked in the implementation of a solution 
  that pre-loaded such classes directly in the docker 
  image used in the nodes.
  
### Organização Educacional Farias Brito - [*www.fariasbrito.com.br*](https://www.fariasbrito.com.br)
*Fortaleza, Brazil* | *Nov 2016 - May 2017*

**Competitive Programming Teacher**
* Taught competitive programming and logic to students
  from 6th to 12th grade in one of the best schools in 
  informatics olympiads in Brazil. Two students 
  classified to the International Olympiad in 
  Informatics in the 2017 Team Selection Tests.

  
Awards
======
* **International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) - 
  Silver Medal** *(2016, Russia)*, **Bronze Medal**
  *(2017, Iran)*

  The IOI was initiated by the UN and is the most 
  prestigious computer science competition for High
  School students in the world. It requires knowledge
  on advanced data structures and algorithms and has 
  contestants from more than 80 countries.

* **Caltech Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Graduate Fellow** 
  *(2021)*

  Fellowship provided to exceptional first-year 
  graduate students in neuroscience options at 
  Caltech.
  
* **MIT EECS Undergraduate Research and Innovation 
  Scholar - SuperUROP** *(2019/2020)*

  A year-long program for selected students in EECS 
  that provides sponsorship and academic advise for 
  their research projects.
  
* **MIT Burchard Scholar** *(2019/2020)*

  Selected group of 38 undergraduate students who 
  have demonstrated outstanding abilities and 
  academic excellence in some aspect of the humanistic
  fields: the humanities, arts, and social sciences.

* **Estudar Fellow** *(2017)*

  Founded by the three most prominent Brazilian 
  businessmen, Fundação Estudar awards scholarships 
  and connects talents who want to positively impact 
  Brazil (33 selected among 83,000 applicants).
