I am an undergraduate student at MIT, majoring in
Computer Science and Engineering and also in Linguistics
and Philosophy. I will graduate in June 2021 and then 
I will begin a PhD program in [Computation and Neural
Systems](https://www.cns.caltech.edu) at Caltech.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive 
Science, Language Acquisition, and Philosophy of Mind.
I am mostly curious about how a better 
understanding of human intelligence and the human
brain can lead to better engineering of 
artificial intelligence.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at the [MIT
Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu), 
and I work under the supervision of [Dr. Mardavij 
Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/).
Our group is working in helping farmers in
underdeveloped countries to increase their productions
and profits with data science. In my research, I use 
Deep Reinforcement Learning to train models that can
learn optimal irrigation and fertilization policies and
provide recommendations to farmers.

Background
======
I am from Brazil. I was born in Teresina but my family 
is from Fortaleza and I lived a few years there. In 
school, I really enjoyed participating in science 
olympiads and I got medals for Brazil in the 
International Olympiad in Informatics in 2016 (Russia)
and 2017 (Iran).

I came to the US for the first time to attend MIT, and
now I live in Cambridge, MA. 

Personal Interests
======
I really love soccer, both playing and watching! When I
am in Brazil, I like to attent the matches of the best
team of the Northeast: [Fortaleza](https://twitter.com/FortalezaEC?s=20).
I also love the Brazilian national team, *the Seleção*, 
and I went to the World Cup in 2014, in Brazil, and in
2018, in Russia! At MIT, we have a Brazilian team called
Ousadia that plays the Intramurals. But I don't score 
much though, I'm a goalie.

I enjoy surfing, I also play the guitar, and I really 
like to read. I prefer non-fiction, humanities or 
social sciences related.
You can see the books I read on my [goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102475638-rogerio-guimaraes-junior).
I reallr enjoy discussing books I've read!

My favorite movies are *Into the Wild (2007)*, *Les 
Misérables (2012)*, and *The Prestige (2006)*. My 
favorite series are *Brooklyn 99*, *New Girl*, *Friends*,
and *How I Met Your Mother*.
