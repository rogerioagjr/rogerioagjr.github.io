I am an undergraduate student at MIT majoring in
Computer Science and Engineering and also in Linguistics
and Philosophy. I will graduate in June 2021 and then 
pursue a PhD in [Computation and Neural
Systems](https://www.cns.caltech.edu) at Caltech.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive 
Science, Language Acquisition, and Philosophy of Mind.
I am mostly curious about how a better 
understanding of human intelligence and the human
brain can lead to better engineering of 
artificial intelligence.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at the [MIT
Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu), 
and I work under the supervision of [Dr. Mardavij 
Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/).
Our group is working in helping farmers in
underdeveloped countries to increase their productions
and profits with data science. In my research, I use 
Deep Reinforcement Learning to train models that can
learn optimal irrigation and fertilization policies and
provide recommendations to farmers.

Background
======
I am from Brazil. I was born in Teresina but my family 
is from Fortaleza and I lived a few years there. In 
school, I really enjoyed participating in science 
olympiads and I got medals for Brazil in the 
[International Olympiad in Informatics](http://ioinformatics.org)
in [2016 (Russia)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/BRA/2016) and 
[2017 (Iran)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/BRA/2017). I came to the
US for the first time to attend MIT, and now I live in
Cambridge, MA. 

I'm latino, I use he/his pronouns, and, for my fellow 
linguists who understand [IPA](https://www.ipachart.com), my name is pronounced
[ʁoˈʒɛɾiu ɡimɐˈɾɐ̃js].

Personal Interests
======
I love soccer, both playing and watching! When I
am in Brazil, I like to attend the matches of the greatest
team in the Northeast: [Fortaleza](https://twitter.com/FortalezaEC?s=20).
I also love the Brazilian national team, *the Seleção*, 
and I went to the World Cup in 2014 in Brazil, and in
2018 in Russia! At MIT, we have a Brazilian team called
*Ousadia* that plays the Intramurals. I don't score 
much though, I'm a goalie.

I enjoy surfing, I also play the guitar, and I really 
like to read. I prefer non-fiction, humanities or 
social sciences-related books.
You can check out the books I read on my [goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102475638-rogerio-guimaraes-junior).

My favorite movies are *Into the Wild (2007)*, *Les 
Misérables (2012)*, and *The Prestige (2006)*. My 
favorite TV series are *Brooklyn 99*, *New Girl*, *Friends*, 
*How I Met Your Mother*, and *The Good Place*.
