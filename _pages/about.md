I am a PhD student in [Computation and Neural
Systems](https://www.cns.caltech.edu) at Caltech, advised by Prof.
[Pietro Perona](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Perona.html). I graduated from MIT in June 2021 with majors in
Computer Science and Engineering and in Linguistics
and Philosophy.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive 
Science, Language Acquisition, and Philosophy of Mind.
I am mostly curious about how a better 
understanding of human intelligence and the human
brain can lead to better engineering of 
artificial intelligence.

At MIT, I worked as an 
undergraduate researcher for two and a half years at 
the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu),
under the 
supervision of [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/).
