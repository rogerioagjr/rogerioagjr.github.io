I graduated from MIT in June 2021 with majors in
Computer Science and Engineering and in Linguistics
and Philosophy. Starting this Fall, I will be pursuing a
PhD in [Computation and Neural
Systems](https://www.cns.caltech.edu) at Caltech. This summer,
I am working with machine learning for 
medical technologies as a Data Science Intern at
[Zeiss](https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html?vaURL=www.zeiss.com/meditec).

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive 
Science, Language Acquisition, and Philosophy of Mind.
I am mostly curious about how a better 
understanding of human intelligence and the human
brain can lead to better engineering of 
artificial intelligence.

At MIT, I worked as an 
undergraduate researcher for two and a half years at 
the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu),
under the 
supervision of [Dr. Mardavij Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/).
