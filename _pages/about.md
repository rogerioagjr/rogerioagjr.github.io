I am an undergraduate student at MIT who is majoring in
Computer Science and Engineering and also in Linguistics
and Philosophy. I will graduate in June 2021, and then 
I will begin a PhD program in [Computation and Neural
Systems](https://www.cns.caltech.edu) at Caltech.

I am interested in Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive 
Science, Language Acquisition, and Philosophy of Mind.
I am mostly curious about how better 
understanding of the human intelligence and the human
brain can lead to better engineering of 
artificial intelligence.

I am currently an undergraduate researcher at the [MIT
Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu), 
and I work under the supervision of [Dr. Mardavij 
Roozbehani](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/mardavij-roozbehani/).
Our group is working in helping farmers in
underdeveloped countries to increase their productions
and profits with data. My research aims to use 
Deep Reinforcement Learning to train models that can
learn optimal irrigation and fertilization policies and
provide recommendations to farmers.
