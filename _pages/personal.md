I am from Brazil. I was born in Teresina but my family
is from Fortaleza and I lived a few years there. In
school, I really enjoyed participating in science
olympiads and I got medals for Brazil in the
[International Olympiad in Informatics](http://ioinformatics.org)
in [2016 (Russia)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/BRA/2016) and
[2017 (Iran)](http://stats.ioinformatics.org/delegations/BRA/2017). I came to the
US for the first time to attend MIT.

I'm latino, I use he/his pronouns, and, for my fellow
linguists who understand [IPA](https://www.ipachart.com), 
my name (Rogério Guimarães) is pronounced
[&#641;oˈʒɛɾiu ɡimɐˈɾɐ̃js].

Personal Interests
======
I love soccer, both playing and watching! When I
am in Brazil, I like to attend the matches of the greatest
team in the Northeast: [Fortaleza](https://twitter.com/FortalezaEC?s=20).
I also love the Brazilian national team, *the Seleção*,
and I went to the World Cup in 2014 in Brazil, and in
2018 in Russia! At MIT, we havegit  a Brazilian team called
*Ousadia* that plays the Intramurals. I don't score
much though, I'm a goalie.

I enjoy surfing, I also play the guitar, and I really
like to read. I prefer non-fiction, humanities or
social sciences-related books.
You can check out the books I read on my [goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/102475638-rogerio-guimaraes-junior).

My favorite movies are *Into the Wild (2007)*, *Les
Misérables (2012)*, and *The Prestige (2006)*. My
favorite TV series are *Brooklyn 99*, *New Girl*, *Friends*,
*How I Met Your Mother*, and *The Good Place*.
