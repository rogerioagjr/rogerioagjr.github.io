I was a teacher of competitive programming for middle 
and high school students preparing for the [Brazilian
Olympiad in Informatics](https://olimpiada.ic.unicamp.br) and the [International
Olympiad in Informatics](ioinformatics.org) at [Organização Educacional
Farias Brito](https://www.fariasbrito.com.br).

I worked there from Nov 2016, after graduating from high
school, until May 2017, before starting university. My 
classes to middle schoolers were mostly about 
programming logic and my classes to high schoolers 
involved advanced algorithms and data structures that
are common in competitive programming.

Three of my students were able to classify to the 
International Olympiad in Informatics. Every year, four
high school students from each associated country 
participate in this competition.
