Noic was founded in 2013 with the goal to promote
scientific olympiads and democratize access to them. Its
website has an olympic journal, study guides, and problem
sets to a lot of national and international olympiads. 
The website has almost 2 million accesses and has always
been completely run by students.

I joined Noic in 2015, and I started the initiative of
writing a course for informatics olympiads from zero. At
that time, there was little online material teaching
competitive programming in Portuguese, and the course
quickly became a widespread source for students who
wanted to learn to code for the olympiad.

From 2016 to 2017 I was the director of the project and
took the initiative further, finding contributors from
other areas to create courses in other disciplines.
