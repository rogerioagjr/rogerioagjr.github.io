CodCad was an online platform that I co-founded in 2016
with two other students, [Lucca](https://luccasiau.com/resume/)
and [Jo√£o](https://joaogui1.netlify.app), and our
informatics teacher, [Thiago](https://neps.academy/user/1).
The platform had an exhaustive course on C++ for 
competitive programming, focusing in the Brazilian 
Olympiad in Informatics.

It was born as an initiative to ease the access to 
programming for middle and high school students. We had
all participated in informatics competitions but there 
were very few schools in Brazil that offered programming 
classes, and we figured out the most impactful thing we 
could do was to develop an online platform.

The website had classes in text and video, problems with
automatic grading, and a lot of features to gamify the 
learning process. 

We reached more than 20,000 users and the platform was 
recommended by the Brazilian Olympiad in Informatics in 
its website. We were also one of the [15 finalists in the
national phase of Microsoft Imagine Cup in 2017](https://news.microsoft.com/pt-br/conheca-os-finalistas-da-etapa-brasileira-da-imagine-cup-2017/).

The platform was discontinued in 2019, but all the 
courses and exercises are maintained in NepsAcademy, a
platform that Thiago later created.
