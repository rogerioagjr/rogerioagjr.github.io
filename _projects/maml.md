This was the final project for a class at MIT
(6.867 - Machine Learning),
done in collaboration with [Kris](https://kristian-georgiev.github.io)
and [Rumen](http://super-ms.mit.edu/rumen.html).

Gradient based meta-learning has established itself as a
promising research direction for problems in
*few-shot learning*: data-constrained training on an
ensemble of tasks with quick adaptation on a task,
unseen during training. Until recently, little has been
known about the success of *model-agnostic meta-learners*
(MAMLs), which are particularly useful to few shot
learning. We shed light on the phenomenon of feature
reuse in MAMLs through empirical visualizations of the
loss landscapes of a variety of tasks. We develop
*meta-visualization*: an efficient framework for
visualization of any gradient based meta learning
algorithm that can be used to generate hypotheses and
guide model designs. The contributions of our work vary
from augmenting research in the field of meta learning
to explaining the success of the method through
geometrical lens.
