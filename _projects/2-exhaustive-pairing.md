title: "[Linguistics] Non-adult Behavior of Childrenâ€™s Quantification
in Logical Deduction Outside of the Language Domain 
(2020)"
excerpt: "Proposed a psycholinguistic experiment to 
evaluate whether exhaustive pairing, a non-adult 
judgement common in children in ages 4 to 6, is caused
by pragmatic or semantic reasons. Experimenters would 
induce children to make the deductive reasoning 
required by quantifiers like every without using them, 
and evaluate whether exhaustive pairing would persist."

This was the final project for a class at MIT 
(24.904 - Language Acquisition).

Children in ages 4 to 6 present the exotic behavior of 
showing non-adult judgements of quantifiers, being 
specifically prone to *exhaustive pairing* errors. In 
the modern literature, the most accepted view about 
what factors cause this behavior suggests that 
pragmatical difficulties in understanding the 
context and the relevant objects to the sentence they 
need to evaluate, rather than semantic differences in 
the child and adult meaning of the quantifiers, are 
responsible for these non-adult judgements. If the 
factors are not semantic, but pragmatic, then we should
also see the same type of non-adult judgement when 
children are presented with tasks that require the same
type of deductive reasoning but do not involve the use
of quantifiers. We propose an experiment to evaluate 
whether this is the case, and discuss the possible 
conclusions that we can draw from its results.
