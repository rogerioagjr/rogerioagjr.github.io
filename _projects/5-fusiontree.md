This was the final project for a class at MIT
(6.851 - Advanced Data Structures).

A Fusion Trees is a static Data Structure that allows 
for predecessor queries in constant time on a set of 
constant size of numbers, but that requires significant 
large word sizes to be implemented in a computer that 
follows the standard word ram model. In this work, we 
provide the C++ code and reference to our implementation
of fusion trees that performs predecessor queries with a
constant number of calls to standard arithmetic 
operations of a general Big Integer.
