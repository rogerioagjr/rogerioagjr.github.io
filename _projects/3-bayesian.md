This was the final project for a class at MIT 
(6.804 - Computational Cognitive Science), done in 
collaboration with [Adib](http://adib-hasan.net)

One of the most important human skills in generalizing 
language is compositionality: once a human learn a new 
word, they can combine it with other previously known
words and generate new sentences that are easily 
understood. For instance, if a person learns the 
meaning of *selfie*, he/she is very likely to understand
*mirror selfie*, *animal selfie* etc.  However, a modern
deep learning model would require vast amount of 
training data to be able to do so. Recently, 
[(Lake et al., 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04587) 
have been able to develop a task that quantitatively 
showed an implication of this crucial difference between
humans and machines. In this paper we shall develop a
Bayesian Inference model that will approximate the human
data.
