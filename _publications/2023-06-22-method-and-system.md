Tomography (OCT) Multi Retinal Layer Segmentation"

excerpt: 'We use a Transformer-based model to segment retinal layers from OCT scans. We 
process an image as 1D sequence of A-scans and treat each of them as a token, instead of
processing a 2D image, which is more computationally efficient.'

A System/Method/Device for automatic retinal layer segmentation from optical coherence 
tomography (OCT) implementing a deep learning machine model defined by any of multiple 
neural networks. The neural networks may use the feature of "attention", and more 
specifically self-attention, such as by using transformers, to reduce the size of the 
OCT data and make the process more efficient. Additionally, new methods of data augmentation 
suitable for OCT data are presented.
